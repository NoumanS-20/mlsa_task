    <h2 style="color: red;">About Our School</h2>
    <p>Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School (東とう京きょう都と立りつ呪じゅ術じゅつ高こう等とう専せん門もん学がっ校こう Tōkyō Toritsu Jujutsu Kōtō Senmon Gakkō, lit. "Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College"), commonly referred to as Tokyo Jujutsu High, is the sister school of Kyoto Jujutsu High. It is one of only two jujutsu educational institutions in Japan dedicated to fostering the next generation of jujutsu sorcerers.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Jujutsu High serves not only as a training ground for the next generation of sorcerers but a headquarters for all alumni who have graduated on to be full-fledged jujutsu sorcerers as well. All sorcerers play a role in mentoring jujutsu students, whether in a teacher's role or accompanying them on missions. Weaker sorcerers are assigned the roles of windows, someone who can see curses but is not considered a full-fledged sorcerer or managers to contribute as well.

      The jujutsu schools are considered the place for the community and provide mediation, general support, education, and shelter.[1]</p>

    The school's curriculum is taught over four years.[12] The concept is to train young sorcerers to control their curses and use them to exorcise other curses. All classes appear to be taught by active professional jujutsu sorcerers. The teachers regulate their students' training regiments and education as they see fit. Sorcerers are rare, so classes are often small and focused on building up the individual students into competent sorcerers as quickly as possible.
    
    First field test (Anime)
    Satoru eventually became a teacher and assigned his students to field missions as training.
    
    Students are given a formal education with standard school classes such as homeroom and sorcerer training through practical jujutsu classes.[13] They move from their original homes to live on campus in the dormitories. The majority of training, classes, and school events are all conducted on campus grounds.
    
    Practical training assignments and field tests often consist of investigating paranormal locations and exorcising weaker curses.[14][15] Jujutsu High students are ranked on the same scale as professional jujutsu sorcerers, which their student ID reflects.[16] Same as jujutsu sorcerers, students are given missions according to their ranking.[17] When leaving school grounds to exorcise curses as a part of their training to gain experience, students are often supervised by a sorcerer or manager.[18]
